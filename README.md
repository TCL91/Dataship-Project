# Mental Health in the Tech Field 2016

(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tyler.loest/viz/MentalHealthProjectWIP/Dashboard1)

## Introduction to the Project
This project is about looking at people's thoughts on mental health in the tech industy in 2016. Mental health is a very important topic that needs to be talked about more. It is often a taboo subject and this project shows how taboo it really was in 2016.

## About the Dataset
- This dataset contains mental health related information in the tech industy in 2016
- There are 1433 observations and 63 features, with each row being a differnt person.
- After adding some features, it now has 70 features.
- You can find the data publicly available here: [[OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey 2016]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016)

## My Approach to Solve this Problem
There are many obervations we can look at by analyzing this data such as INSERT COUPLE SOMETHING HERE, etc. Those aren't the main objectives of this project but can be abserved. The main scope of this porject is to see **how taboo mental health is in the tech field.** 

I will be focusing on both quantitative data and qualitative data.


## Technical Approach in This Project
- Initial pre-processing
    - Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
    - in this notebook, I try and look at each feature and determine how much it would actually contribute to meaningful predictions when it comes to analysis. 
    - fill in NaN and unknown values
    - end result is a dataset that I can use for visualization and analysis
    

- Feature cleaning & engineering
    - Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
    - here I take the cleaned data from the previous notebook and continue to filter out unneccessary features
    - utillize categorical feature encoding

- Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
    - I take the unprocessed original data and just do a quick scatter mapbox visualization showing the location of each break, with the size being the number of breaks the pipe has experienced


## Limitations of Analysis
-The data only applies to the people who responded and are in the tech field
    -Other industries might have different responses to mental health taboo
-The project currently shows only one year. 
    -However their are other datasets from the same researchers conducted which could be used in the future to compare trends over the years. 

## Data Cleaning
The cleaning file was to data formating and to add features so the data can be interpreted better such as categorizing the free form answers in certain features

## Data Analysis
This section covers the overall approach that was taken after pre-processing the data, basically covering the whole EDA process.

So far there are only a few completed visuals. As I iterate over the project, more visualizations will be added.

## Key Takeaways


## Business Recommendation
